        This year, just around the corner of Amazon and Microsoft offices, the event will be partly focused on the theme "PHP & the Cloud": tools, continuous integration, security, costs... But of course, a lot of talks will be about PHP itself, innovation and improvement. Julien Pauli, Thibaut Lenclos, Wim Godden, Oswald de Riemaecker and François Zaninotto are the first speakers confirmed for the event. Who will join this dream team? Stay tuned to discover the program in the next few days.
        <br/>
        Presentation length is 45 minutes which includes question time. 3 hours workshops with limited audience are planned.
