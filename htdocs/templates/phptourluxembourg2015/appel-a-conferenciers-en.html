				<p>AFUP is glad to announce that the call for paper for the next PHP Tour is now open. The fourth edition of the PHP Tour will be held in Luxembourg City on the 12th and 13th of May, 2015. As a PHP expert, share your advanced knowledge and experience with developers, decision makers and companies.</p>

				<h3>Theme</h3>

				<p>World wide phenomenon, new direction for the Web or simple trend, nowadays no one can ignore the Cloud. From professionals to simple consumers, everybody heard about it and can use it but few knows how it really works, how it's organized. Who knows how to set up a server in the Cloud? How to change it without downtime? Who knows how to secure its application thanks to the Cloud or how to deploy a machine on Amazon or Azure services?</p>

				<p>If you feel in harmony with the Cloud or if it has no secret for you, join us to the PHP Tour Luxembourg 2015 to talk about it! Just around the corner of Amazon and Microsoft offices, this event organized by AFUP will be mainly focused on this theme. Here are some topics we would like to be addressed:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Tools for the Cloud: tell us about your IDE/VM/workflows dedicated to PHP in the Cloud
					</li>
					<li>Continuous Integration: share your experience about continuous integration of PHP app in the Cloud</li>
					<li>Security and the Cloud: explain to us the concerns of using PHP and the Cloud altogether</li>
					<li>Cost of the Cloud: you successfully deploy your infrastructure in the Cloud, give us your feedback on the real costs of such an environment</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Familiar with any of the above topics? AFUP will be glad to hear from you! Come to present the technical choices you made, your thoughts and the difficulties you had to solve. You achieved a migration from a private server to a Cloud hosting ? Explain us how.</p>

				<p>Let's think bigger! You did set up a workflow capable of deploy in production your app from a single commit, don't keep it to yourself. Any other fascinating subject to share with the PHP community? Send us your proposition for a talk. All of them will be studied on the same level: sky is the limit!</p>

				<h3>Practical Informations</h3>

				<p>For the first time, as a wish to represent all the french speaking PHP developers, the PHP Tour will take place off the french territory: AFUP and the locale branch of Luxembourg will welcome you on may the 12th and 13th, 2015 in The Abbey of Neum√ºnster, a historical venue in the heart of Luxembourg City.</p>
